    <h1>France</h1>
    <h4>Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights.
    We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.
    We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.
    France in the middle of one of its hottest summers on record when we visited.
    We spent time at the beach in Normandy as well as enjoying plenty of shaded cafes!</h4>

    <h3>We tried to travel every weekend, and some of our highlights are below:</h3>

  <p>We kept coming back to the Eiffel Tower, enjoying just hanging out in the park around its base.
     We also enjoyed going to the top of the tower and the incredible view of Paris, not to mention eating delicious ice cream while up there.</p>
